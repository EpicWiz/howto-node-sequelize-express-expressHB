In the development object you will find the credentials that your computer will
use to access the database on your local computer. That is what you will use during
development.
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_production",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
In the production object, the values will be defined by whatever place your application
will be hosted. For example, on heroku you may use JAWSdb for your mysql database. In that
case you would have to fill the values relative the JAWSdb credentials.
